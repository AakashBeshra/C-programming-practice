/*You are given an array A of size N.

Let  be the minimum value present in the array initially.
In one operation, you can choose an element Ai(1 <= i <= N) and an integer X(1 <= X <= 100), and set A1 = X.

Determine the minimum number of operations required to make M the maximum value in the array A.
